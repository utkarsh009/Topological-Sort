# Topological-Sort
Topological Sort implemented using Linked List written by me from scratch.

# Assumption
Vertices are labelled from 0 and must contain all the numbers from 0 to SIZE-1. The program can be improved in this aspect by a slight modification, but this is only for my own (and anybody who wishes to revise) reference purpose so it doesn't matter much.

# Disclaimer
This isn't supposed to be a user friendly program and is targeted towards competitive coding and exams.
